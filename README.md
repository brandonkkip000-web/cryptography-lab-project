This  was assigned to us as a group project by the cryptography lecturer. It shows how to combine building-block primitives into a practical workflow: hashing a password, computing a file digest, encrypting with AES, wrapping the AES key with RSA, signing metadata and verifying integrity.

- bcrypt for password hashing
- SHA-256 for file fingerprinting
- AES-256-GCM for authenticated encryption
- RSA (OAEP) for AES key wrapping
- RSA-PSS for digital signatures
